# Time Lord 9000
A simple prototype of a 2D game with time rewind ability similar to prince of persia or braid.

This project uses [Advance c# Messenger](http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php?title=Advanced_CSharp_Messenger) with a small modification. It  uses enum to identify events instead of string.
